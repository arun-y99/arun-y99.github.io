అందరికి నమస్కారం! This is my first website. Why? Because everyone has one, that's why! Having a website has many advantages the way I see it. It allows you to consolidate all your professional stuff into one place. It answers the question, 'Who is this guy? What does he do?'. Having a website is way better. A website is more professional and decent. It can be your official part of the Internet. You get to decide what to put on it. Its really nice. So I am now creating and hosting my website.

This is just a first post. That's it.
